Question:  Is this the first time you are using GitHub with a team? How is the experience going?


Rachel's response:
I have used GitHub before for personal projects, but this is my first time using it with a team. It is going to take some practice
getting used to the new commands.


Shanaz's response:
I've used Github for classes like COP 1500 and COP 3003, so I have a little experience with it, but I never used it with a team. 
It's different from using it alone but I think it can be useful for big projects with a team.


Wilkenson's response:
This will be my second time being on a team on Github. It was honestly a nightmare, but I have high hopes for us.


Ronald's response:
Yes, this is my first time using GitHub with a team. I used it a little bit before for my COP class, but I always worked by myself.
Thus, I am not so sure about how to work on this with a team. I am editing the file hoping that I can save it on my branch right now.
